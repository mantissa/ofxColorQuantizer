* added example-weights and ColorConverter.h by stc
copied from the stc user fork: https://github.com/stc/ofxColorQuantizer/
This example can get colors weighted based on their areas, their order is based on their chroma values.

* added example-weights2 by moebiussurfing
This current fork has another example that can sort by Hue, Saturation, Brightness or the above method.
It has a gui panel too to change the number of colors, the sorting type, rebuild when changing number of colors... on the fly.
There's some image loading from url too.
